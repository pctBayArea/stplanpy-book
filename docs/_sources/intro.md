# Sustainable Transportation Planner for Python

Welcome to stplanpy, the Sustainable Transportation Planner for Python. This
package is inspired by [stplanr](https://docs.ropensci.org/stplanr/), a package
for sustainable transport planning with R {cite}`lovelace2017`. This Jupyter
Book shows an example of how to use this Python package. The focus is on
origin-destination (flow) data for Stanford University, Palo Alto, and East Palo
Alto. Only commutes in the San Francisco Bay Area are considered. 

The source code for this package can be found on
[github.com](https://github.com/pctBayArea/stplanpy) and documentation is
available on
[github.io](https://pctbayarea.github.io/stplanpy/source/stplanpy.html).

This library is also hosted on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/stplanpy/) and
can be installed using pip:

`pip install stplanpy`
