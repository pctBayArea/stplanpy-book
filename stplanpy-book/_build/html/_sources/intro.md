# Sustainable Transportation Planner for Python

Welcome to stplanpy, the Sustainable Transportation Planner for Python. This
package is inspired by stplanr, a package for sustainable transport planning
with R {cite}`lovelace2017`. This Jupyter Book shows an example of how to use
this Python package. The focus is on origin-destination (flow) data for Stanford
University, Palo Alto, and East Palo Alto. Only commutes in the San Francisco
Bay Area are considered.
